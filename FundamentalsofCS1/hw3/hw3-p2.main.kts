// Homework 3, Problem 2
// -----------------------------------------------------------------

// TODO 1/4: Design the data type FlashCard to represent a single
//           flash card. You should be able to represent the text
//           prompt on the front of the card as well as the text
//           answer on the back. Include at least 3 example cards
//           (which will come in handy later for tests!).
//

// TODO 2/4: Design the data type Deck to represent a deck of
//           flash cards. The deck should have a name, as well
//           as a sequence of flash cards.
//
//           Include at least 2 example decks based upon the
//           card examples above.
//

// TODO 3/4: Design the predicate areAllOneWordAnswers that
//           determines if the backs of all the cards in a deck
//           are a single word (i.e., have no spaces, which
//           includes a card with a blank back).
//
//           Hint: hidden in the name of this function is a
//                 reminder of a useful list function to use :)
//

// A couple potentially helpful examples for tests
// val fcEmptyBack = FlashCard("Front", "")
// val fcLongBack = FlashCard("Front", "Long answer")

// TODO 4/4: Design the predicate anyContainsPhrase that determines
//           if any of the cards in a deck contain the supplied
//           phrase.
//
//           Hints:
//           - string1.contains(string2) will be quite useful
//             here :)
//           - Again, the name of this function hints at a useful
//             list function we learned!
//
