// Homework 6, Problem 1
// -----------------------------------------------------------------

// In this problem, you'll practice with looping and mutation to
// implement a form of the functional `map` function to actually
// change the elements of a supplied list (instead of returning
// a new list).

// TODO 1/1: Design the function myInplaceMap, which transforms the
//           elements of a supplied list using a supplied function.
//
//           For example, if the function was supplied [1, 2, 3] as
//           a mutable list, as well as a function that doubles a
//           supplied number, the supplied list would be [2, 4, 6]
//           after the function completed (note that the function
//           itself should not return any value).
//
//           Make sure to sufficiently test this function,
//           including empty vs lists that have elements, as well
//           as differing types.
